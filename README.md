# Auto-Vector
A script that automates the process of vectorizing a picture using the website vectorization.eu. The script is written in Python and uses the Selenium library to navigate and interact with the website. The script follows a step-by-step algorithm to upload an image, select the output format (SVG in this example), and click the "vectorize" button until the vector file is generated and downloaded. The script also uses Selenium's expected_conditions module to wait for certain elements on the website to appear, such as the "start_conversion" button and the download link. Additionally, the script uses a loop to retry the conversion process if necessary and a time.sleep() function to wait for the download to complete before opening the download folder. Please keep in mind that in order for the script to work properly you should change the file path to your download folder in the code.
